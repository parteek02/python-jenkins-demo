## üìò What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository‚Äîoften several times a day. Each integration is verified by an **automated build and test suite**, allowing teams to detect problems early.

### üîç Main Objectives of CI

- Catch issues early (bugs, merge conflicts, integration issues)
- Improve software quality through regular validation
- Shorten feedback cycles for developers
- Automate testing, builds, and basic validation processes

## ‚úÖ Why CI is Important

| Reason               | Explanation                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early Bug Detection  | Tests run automatically when code is committed.                   |
| Faster Development   | Immediate feedback prevents bottlenecks.                          |
| Stable Builds        | Only healthy, passing code is merged.                             |
| Team Collaboration   | Multiple developers can work on the same codebase with confidence.|
| Increased Confidence | Changes are validated continuously.                               |

# üß™ CI Checks

**CI checks** are automated verifications that run every time a developer:

- Pushes code
- Submits a pull request
- Manually triggers a build

They ensure that the code:

- Builds correctly
- Meets code standards
- Passes all tests
- Is secure
- Does not break existing features

## üîß Why Do We Use CI Checks?

| Reason                  | Explanation                                                                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Catch Bugs Early        | Detect issues during development, not after deployment.                               |
| Enforce Code Quality    | Linting and analysis enforce standards.                                               |
| Ensure Stable Builds    | Only valid code proceeds to deployment.                                               |
| Run Tests Automatically | Continuous validation through automated testing.                                      |
| Security Scanning       | Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.                                                |
| Fast Feedback           | Developers get immediate results after commits.                                       |
| Team Collaboration      | Smooth integration between contributors.                                              |
| Confidence to Release   | Prevent regressions and improve release readiness.                                    |
| Save Time & Cost        | Catching bugs early is cheaper and faster.                                            |
| Automate Checks         | Remove repetitive manual tasks.                                                       |

# üß© Types of CI Checks

| Type                      | Purpose                                                       | How to Implement                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linting (Code Style Check)| Enforce formatting and style guidelines.                      | Use `flake8`, `pylint` (Python), `Checkstyle` (Java), `golint` (Go).             |
| Unit Tests                | Test individual functions/classes.                            | Use `pytest` (Python), `JUnit` (Java), `go test` (Go).                           |
| Integration Tests         | Validate interaction across modules/components.                | Use real services or mocks in integration test suites.                          |
| Build Checks              | Ensure successful project builds.                             | Use `javac`, `go build`, Python packaging tools.                                |
